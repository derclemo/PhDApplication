abstract="This contribution is an overview of our recent work on the concept of centrality in networks. Instead of proposing new centrality indices, providing faster algorithms, or presenting new rules for when an index can be classified as a centrality, this research shifts the focus to the more elementary question whether a node is in a more central position than another. Viewing networks as data on overlapping dyads, and defining the position of a node as the whole of its relationships to the rest of the network, we obtain a very general procedure for doing centrality analysis; not only on social networks but networks from all kinds of domains. Our framework further suggests a variety of computational challenges.",
